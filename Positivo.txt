I don't know Mr. @wallyadeyemo, but I am very proud of his accomplishment to date. The upcoming @JoeBiden / @KamalaHarris administration is sending a clear message about competence, character, and credentials. Bravo!
Love these books selected by the seven year old for bedtime tonight. She’s very excited about @JoeBidenand @KamalaHarris, and tonight even declared if she ever has a girl she’s naming her Kamala.
Now this is a real President! A fit and competent man that uses a cigar box as a pen holder. That alone would have had my vote had this circulated before elections. @JoeBiden reuse, reduce, recycle.
We really miss our new year, but due to the pandemic we are being safe. Thanks president elect @JoeBidenand @DrBiden for thinking of us Hmong people during this pandemic times during the Hmong New Year!
It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, and listen to each other again. To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans.
Trump Topped All GOP Presidential Candidates in African-American Support Going Back to ’90s
Bernie Sanders is still 10x better than Biden. At least he's against wars and selling out America.
Stacey Abrams is a hard worker for the Dems. Very loyal. She got passed over for a huge opportunity and still hustles for her party.
Good, I hope the election system does get completely overhauled. It has to be more fraud-proof.
Not a surprise that @JoeBiden is going to do the right thing, which is fight for his OMB director nominee Neera Tanden.   She's qualified for the job, worked hard her whole life and she should be supported.
Will be going to Georgia for a big Trump Rally in support of our two great Republican Senators, David and Kelly. They are fantastic people who love their Country and love their State. We must work hard and be sure they win.
